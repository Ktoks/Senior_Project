# Senior project

## Technical Overview

It is not yet fast or reliable. More research is needed to fulfill this requirement.

It is secure because it's local.

In general, it is lightweight.

It is flexible.

It is able to run on any editor.

I have included the mapping part of the project, but have yet to implement each indevidual mapping.

Shift-key has not been implemented yet. __Might just need .upper() and an if statement or different mode__

Caps-lock is not yet implemented. __Might just need .upper() and an if statement or different mode__

Changing modes is not yet implemented. Except where ctrl-c is pressed.

Exiting a mode is not yet implemented. Except where ctrl-c is pressed.

Mapping to specific commands is possible, but not suggested, now that I have tested it.

It is flexible when selecting a master hotword. Current hotword needs work.

## Milestones

### 1. __Master hotword and null mode:__

The user can say any voice-activating hotword to start listening.
> This can be any word the user chooses that isn't used in regular conversation, but must be thoroughly trained.

### 2. __Field mode:__

Currently: field mode is working, without the mode changing and hot-word.
> User: "Hey Sae field mode"

### 3. __Mode hotwords:__

Not yet implemented.
> The above together are a two-step process that allows the user to choose which mode to use.

### 4. __Edit mode:__(Advanced)

Not yet implemented.
> User: "Hey Sae edit mode; highlight; move down two lines; cut; move up three lines; paste; Hey Sae field mode;"

### 5. __Training mode:__(Near-Impossible)

Not implemented. __Needs environment mode?__
> The user would then say the word they want to train, the algorithm would make it's best guess at how it is spelled, then ask for confirmation. The user will decide if the algorithm is correct or not. If not, it will as for the user to spell it, then confirm that the spelling on the screen is correct too.

### 6. __Settings mode:__(Advanced)

Not implemented.
> This mode would be very restricted, only a few basic commands would execute.

### 7. __Environment mode:__(Advanced)

Not implemented.
